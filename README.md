# Matlab-Scientific-Calculator
A full-purpose Matlab Calculator that performs arithmetic operations, calculus, differential equations, 2D & 3D Graphs, and Base Conversions.

## Calculator
The Calculator file opens a basic GUI that acts as the main menu for the project. In it, you can access all of the operations of a scientific calculator. (when running the project, access the calculator.m file first.)

## Arith
The Arith file opens a full calculator layout for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication purposes.

## Calculus
The Calculus file opens a GUI that allows for integral and differential operations of several orders.

## Conversions
The Conversions file allows for base conversions between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal bases.

## Graph2D
The Graph2D file displays graphs in 2D space.

## Graph3D
The Graph3D file displays graphs in 3D space.

# Differential
The Differential file solves Differential equations.
